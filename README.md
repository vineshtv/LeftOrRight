#LeftOrRight
A neural network which you can teach left from right.

The neural network code in this project is the old neural network implemented in Javascript(includes the NN code as well as the Matrix multiplication code).

In this visualization there is a grid of 28 x 28. In each iteration, a single cell in the grid will be highlighted and 
the NN will predict whether it is on the left side or the right side. And on every iteration you can tell it whether it was correct
by clicking on the correct side of the grid. Eventually it will learn left from right and will start predicting correctly.

If/when you get bored trying to teach it, just press SPACE and it will automatically train for 10000 iterations and get trained
and ready to show you its new found skill.
